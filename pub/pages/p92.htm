        <b>Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)</b>is a set of rating systems for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green buildings, homes and neighborhoods.

    </p><h3>Rating systems<span> [edit]</span></h3>
    <p>
        LEED has evolved since 1998 to more accurately represent and incorporate emerging green building technologies. The pilot version, LEED New Construction (NC) v1.0, led to LEED NCv2.0, then LEED NCv2.2 in 2005.
    </p>
    <p>
        LEED was most recently updated in 2009, to LEEDv3. It encompasses nine rating systems for the design, construction and operation of buildings, homes and neighborhoods. Five overarching categories correspond to the specialties available under the LEED Accredited Professional program. That suite currently consists of:
